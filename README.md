# Authorship-Profiling-on-Twitter-Data


### Objective: 
A machine learning classification of the approach to determine the gender of the author given the tweets. 

### The three major tasks in this project are:

#### Data Pre-processing: 
This step involves stop word removal, most frequent word, and least frequent word removal, stemming, lemmatization, lowercasing.
#### Feature Extraction: 
Methods such as TF-IDF, Word2Vec, Doc2Vec were implemented to extract features. TF-IDF worked well for the data.
#### Model Building: 
As the data was linearly separable, linear classification models were applied and compared.
